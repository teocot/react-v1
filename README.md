4. GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is one of the fastest and most widely used methods for beginners to deploy websites. It’s easier to maintain than many other tools described in this guide. With GitHub actions, you can trigger automatic deployments, configure CI/CD, and much more.

Create a GitHub account if you haven’t already, then create a repository for your application.

In your terminal, initialize the local directory as a Git repository, commit all the changes, and push it to remote by running the following command in the project root.

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git remote add origin .git
git push -u origin master
You’ll get this repository URL when you create a new repository.

GitHub Repo URL
With this, your project will be pushed to GitHub.

In your project’s package.json add a homepage field, like this:

"homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app"
myusername is your GitHub username and my-app is your repository’s name.

Next, install gh-pages in your project.

npm install --save gh-pages
In your package.json, add the following scripts.

"scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
predeploy and deploy are the only additions to the scrips. predeploy will automatically run before deploy and make sure the latest build of the application is deployed.

Run the following command to deploy the application.

npm run deploy
This command will create a new branch named gh-pages in your project’s GitHub repository. You may need to set a source under the GitHub Pages option in your repository’s settings to gh-pages branch.

Local deployments and run
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
